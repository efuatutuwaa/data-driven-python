**Analyzing School SAT Performance with Pandas**

This project focuses on manipulating and analyzing a dataset of school performance, specifically SAT scores, using Python's Pandas library. The objective is to derive insights such as identifying top-performing schools, calculating total SAT scores, and analyzing borough-level performance in terms of SAT score variability.

**Key Objectives**:
- Filter and identify schools with the highest average math scores.
- Calculate and rank schools based on their total SAT scores (math, reading, and writing combined).
- Identify the top 10 performing schools based on total SAT scores.
- Analyze boroughs with the highest variability in SAT scores by calculating the standard deviation of SAT scores within each borough.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**:
- Data loading and inspection: Reading data from CSV and exploring the dataset structure.
- Filtering and sorting: Selecting schools based on math performance and ranking them.
- Column creation: Deriving a new column for total SAT scores.
- Grouping and aggregation: Grouping schools by borough to calculate the mean and standard deviation of SAT scores.
- Renaming columns: Cleaning up the column names for clarity and readability.
