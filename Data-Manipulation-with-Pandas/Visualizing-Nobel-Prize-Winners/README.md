**Analyzing Nobel Prize Winners with Pandas**

This project analyzes data on Nobel Prize winners and provides insights into trends and patterns over time. Using Python's Pandas library, we manipulate and explore the dataset to uncover interesting facts about Nobel Prize winners, such as the distribution of awards across different categories, countries, and the gender diversity of the winners. Additionally, the project features visualizations to make the findings more interpretable.


**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess the Nobel Prize dataset.
- Explore key trends in the dataset (e.g., which countries produce the most Nobel laureates, changes in award categories over time).
- Visualize the distribution of Nobel Prize winners by gender, category, country, and year.
- Perform analysis on the age of winners and identify trends in terms of which fields produce younger vs. older laureates.

**Key Objectives**:

- Data Wrangling:
  - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
  - Clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values and transforming columns.
  - Use Pandas for filtering, grouping, and summarizing data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
  - Group by country, category, and gender to analyze the number of Nobel Prize winners.
  - Create new columns, such as age at the time of award, to enhance analysis.

- Data Visualization:
  - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations.
  - Plot the distribution of Nobel laureates by year, category, and country.
  - Visualize gender diversity among winners.
  - Plot the age distribution of laureates at the time of their award.


**Technology and Tools**

- Python: Core programming language used throughout the project.
- Pandas: For data manipulation, filtering, grouping, and aggregation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization.
